# Capstone 2019 Dollaride Repo

 While New York City has developed public transportation networks provided by MTA, a huge number of people living in outer boroughs are left outside the networks. These people are living in “transit deserts” and have a strong demand for transportation means. Part of the demand is met by so-called “dollar vans” – a chain of thousands of privately owned commuter vans which run across the NYC. A startup called “Dollaride” connects drivers and passengers in these marginalized communities using an  innovative transportation technology.
The project identifies methodology for calculating transit deserts (transit-underserved areas in terms of specific transit supply-demand equilibrium) in a large city. The methodology is based on earlier developed attitude by Jiao and Dillivan (2013), but some different parameters characterising a first-tier American city were suggested.  The outcome of the project is a map of transit deserts in NYC, based on a solid quantitative analysis and data. Another practical implication of the project is a list of new routes for Dollaride, which would benefit its passengers, drivers and NYC transportation authorities.

## For Hire Vehicles (FHV)
- NYC OpenData offers yearly FHV data.
- Due to the size of the data, I used Postgresql to minimize memory usage.
- Following figures are representing the numbef of trips between zones(Left: Weekday, Middle: Weekend, Right: Internal Trip)
- The figure of trip in weekday and weekend is same.
